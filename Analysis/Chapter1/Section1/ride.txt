Analysis: Your Ride Is Here

This is probably the easiest problem in the entire set of lessons. An `ad hoc' problem, no particular algorithms or tricks are needed save one: one must be careful to get all 72 characters of input without processing the newline on the end!

Here is a prototype solution:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>

int
hash(char *s)
{
	int i, h;

	h = 1;
	for(i=0; s[i] && isalpha(s[i]); i++)
		h = ((s[i]-'A'+1)*h) % 47;
	return h;
}

void
main(void)
{
	FILE *in, *out;
	char comet[100], group[100];  /* bigger than necessary, room for newline */

	in = fopen("input.txt", "r");
	out = fopen("output.txt", "w");

	fgets(comet, sizeof comet, in);
	fgets(group, sizeof group, in);

	if(hash(comet) == hash(group))
		fprintf(out, "GO\n");
	else
		fprintf(out, "STAY\n");
	exit (0);
}

Solutions generally run in under 0.01 seconds.
