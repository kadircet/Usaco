Suppose we knew how to calculate the size of the set of binary numbers for a given nbits and nones. That is, suppose we have a function sizeofset(n, m) that returns the number of n-bit binary numbers that have at most m ones in them.

Then we can solve the problem as follows. We're looking for the ith element in the set of size n with m bits. This set has two parts: the numbers the start with zero, and the numbers that start with one. There are sizeofset(n-1, m) numbers that start with zero and have at most m one bits, and there are sizeofset(n-1, m-1) numbers that start with one and have at most m one bits.

So if the index is less than sizeofset(n-1, m), the number in question occurs in the part of the set that is numbers that start with zero. Otherwise, it starts with a one.

This lends itself to a nice recursive solution, implemented by "printbits".

The only difficult part left is calculating "sizeofset". We can do this by dynamic programming using the property described above:

	sizeofset(n, m) = sizeofset(n-1, m) + sizeofset(n-1, m-1)
and sizeofset(0, m) = 1 for all m. We use double's throughout for bits, but that's overkill given the rewritten problem that requires only 31 bits intead of 32.
