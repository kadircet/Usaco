Money Systems
Russ Cox
We use dynamic programming to count the number of ways to make n cents with the given coins. If we denote the value of the kth coin by c_k, then the recurrence is:

   nway(n, k) = no. of ways to make n cents with the first k types of coins
   nway(n, k) = nway(n, k-1) + nway(n-c_k, k)
This just says the number of ways to make n cents with the first k coins is the number of ways to make n cents using the first k-1 coins (i.e., without using the kth coin) plus the number of ways to make n-c_k cents using the first k coins. For the second set of ways, we then add the kth coin to arrive at a total of n cents.

We keep track of the number of ways to total "n" cents in "nway", updating the array as we read the value of each coin.
