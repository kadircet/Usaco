The Tamworth Two
Russ Cox
We can simply simulate the movement of Farmer John and the two cows, but we need to find a way to detect loops. There are only 100 places where the cows can be, and 4 directions they can face. The same goes for Farmer John. This multiplies out to 400*400 = 160,000 different (place, direction) configurations for Farmer John and the cows. If we ever happen upon a configuration we have been in before, we are in an infinite loop, and John and the cows will never meet.

In fact, we don't even need to keep track of which configurations we've seen. If they're going to meet, they're going to meet in fewer than 160,000 steps. Otherwise, they have to repeat some configuration, in which case they'll never meet.

We take care of the simulation by keeping track of the position and direction of each. Direction is a number from 0 to 3, 0 = north, 1 = east, 2 = south, 3 = west. So turning clockwise is incrementing one. We calculate how to move given the direction by looking up offsets in the deltax and deltay arrays.
