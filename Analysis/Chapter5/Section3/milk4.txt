This is a dynamic programming problem with a few tricks thrown in. We keep three arrays: minPails, the fewest pails needed to get to a given number of quarts; lastPail, the pail tacked on to a smaller sequence to find the current best solution for a given number of quarts; and nLast, the number of identical pails at the end of the current best sequence.

We iterate through the set of pails, each time scanning from 0 quarts to Q quarts to try to improve a sequence by seeing if we can achieve it using fewer pails than we've found so far. We basically try to add as many of the current pail as we can to earlier sequences in order to improve them; note that an improvement is not just a reduction in the number of pails required but also finding a set of pails which are smaller than the previously used ones.

There's one exception, though: let's say we've got two pails of size 4 and 5. If we've already found out that we can get 20 quarts with only a 4-quart pail, then when we iterate with the 5-quart pail minPails[25] will be set to 2 because achieving 20 quarts with only a 5-quart pail isn't an improvement over what we already have. Thus if we can't improve minPails with a new pail, but we can match what we already have, we'll overwrite its old value anyway; this way, when we remember that 20 quarts can also be achieved with a single 5-quart pail, we can use it again to get to 25 quarts with a single pail. Because of this overwriting, we need to remember how many times a pail has to be filled to get to a given capacity, so we store that in the array nLast.

By iterating through the set of pails this way, the lists we are storing refer to the smallest set of pails which use the pail sizes we've seen most recently. In order to come up with the smallest pails first, then, we simply sort the pails in descending order before beginning the DP so that the most recently used pails are the smallest ones. After having gone through every pail, then, we backtrack using the nLast and lastPail arrays, and we are done.
