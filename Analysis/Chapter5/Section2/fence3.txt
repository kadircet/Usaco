Electric Fences
Brian Jacokes
To solve this problem, all we need to do is place the power source in a random location and start trying to move it around in various directions, decreasing the amount that we move it by as time goes on. To begin with, we can place the power source at (0,0), although any location will work just as well. Next, we move it in large increments (20 works well at first) about 10 times or so. This will put us in the general location of the optimal location. Now we decrease the amount by which we move the power source to 1/10 of what it previously was and run the same process again. Running the whole placement process about 5 times, decreasing the amount by which we move the power source each time, will give us the best location for the power source.
